    ### App Overview:
    This app uses various regression models to predict the academic performance of students, specifically their percentage. 
    We provide three machine learning models for prediction:
    - **Linear Regression**: A basic algorithm for predicting continuous variables based on linear relationships.
    - **Random Forest**: A robust ensemble learning method that works by combining several decision trees to improve predictions.
    - **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)**: A method that works by finding the best hyperplane to predict continuous values in high-dimensional spaces.

    The model will be trained on student data and its performance will be evaluated using metrics like **Mean Squared Error** and **R-squared**.

    ### Steps:
    1. **Dataset Loading**: The student data is loaded from a CSV file.
    2. **Data Preprocessing**: The data is standardized for better performance in some models.
    3. **Model Training**: You can select any model from the options provided.
    4. **Model Evaluation**: The app will display metrics to evaluate the model's performance.
